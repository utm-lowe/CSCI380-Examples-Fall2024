    "# The Game of NIM\n",
    "Nim is a classic mathematical strategy game, variants of which have been played since ancient times. The game itself is rather simple, and you don't need much equiment to play it. The idea is that you have `n` piles of things (seeds, stones, coins, etc.) The first pile has one item in it, the second has two, and so on. You can easily adjust the game by increasing or decreasing the number of piles. For example, a 3 pile game may look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1: *\n",
    "2: **\n",
    "3: ***\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the game of nim, players take turns. On your turn you must remove any number of things from one pile. The object of the game is to not take the last stone. "
